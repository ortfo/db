### Package managers

::: tip
Package files are also available to download from [Github Releases](https://github.com/ortfo/db/releases), in case the package manager's repositories are not up-to-date enough
:::

::: warning
This is my first time packaging a program to practically all package managers. I'm not familiar with most of them. If the installation does not work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ortfo/db/issues/new).

### Using `go`

```bash
go install github.com/ortfo/db/cmd@latest
```

### Building from source

#### Requirements

- [Go](https://go.dev)
- [Just](https://just.systems): a modern alternative to Makefiles[^1]. See [Just's docs on installation](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gwennlbh/portfoliodb`
2. `cd` into it: `cd portfoliodb`
3. Compile & install in `~/.local/bin/` `just install`... or simply build a binary to your working directory: `just build`.

[^1]: One big advantage of Just is that it works painlessly on Windows.
